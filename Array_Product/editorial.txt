Given an array of numbers A of size N, find and print array of numbers P of size N, where P[i] is the product of all
numbers A[j], where j!=i.

A naive approach would be, to find ith element of output array(i.e. P[i]), iterate over an entire input array A to
get the product of all elements A[j], such that j!=i.

Time Complexity: O(N*N)
Auxiliary Space Used: O(1)

An optimal approach would be as follows:
Notice that for P[i], product of all input array elements other than ith element is nothing but
                       (product of all elements A[j], 0<=j<=(i-1)) * (product of all elements A[j], (i+1)<=j<=(N-1))
                     = (A[0]*A[1]*...*A[i-1]) * (A[i+1]*A[i+2]*...*A[N-1])

So, iterate input array A twice to fill output array P, once for updating P[i] with (A[0]*A[1]*...*A[i-1]), and next
one for updating P[i] with (A[i+1]*A[i+2]*...*A[N-1]).
Please see the commented code for detailed implementation of optimal approach.
