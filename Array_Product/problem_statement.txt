Array Product



Problem Statement:

Given an array of numbers nums of size n, find an array of numbers products of size n, such that products[i] is the product of all numbers nums[j], where j!=i.



Input Format:
There is only one argument: nums, denoting input array



Output Format:
Return an array of numbers products, denoting the required product array



Constraints:

You can't use division anywhere in solution
2 <= n <= 100000
-2147483648 <= nums[i] <= 2147483647, i=1,2,3,...,n
-2147483648 <= products[i] <= 2147483647, i=1,2,3,...,n


Notes:

Usage of resultant products array will not be considered as extra space used.
Without using division is the key constraint to remember.


Sample Test Cases:



Sample Input 1:
5
1
2
3
4
5



Sample Output 1:
120
60
40
30
24



Explaination 1:
Resultant Product array products = [products[1], products[2], products[3], products[4], products[5]]
                = [(nums[2]*nums[3]*nums[4]*nums[5]), (nums[1]*nums[3]*nums[4]*nums[5]), (nums[1]*nums[2]*nums[4]*nums[5]), (nums[1]*nums[2]*nums[3]*nums[5]), (nums[1]*nums[2]*nums[3]*nums[4])]
                = [(2*3*4*5), (1*3*4*5), (1*2*4*5), (1*2*3*5), (1*2*3*4)]
                = [120, 60, 40, 30, 24]





Sample Input 2:
3
4
9
10



Sample Output 2:
90
40
36



Explaination 2:
Resultant Product array products = [products[1], products[2], products[3]]
                          = [(nums[2]*nums[3]), (nums[1]*nums[3]), (nums[1]*nums[2])]
                          = [(9*10), (4*10), (4*9)]
                          = [90, 40, 36] 





Suggestions:
Suggested time in interview: 20 minutes.
The “Suggested Time” is the time expected to complete this question during a real-life interview, not now in homework i.e. For the first attempt of a given homework problem, the focus should be to understand what the problem is asking, what approach you are using, coding it, as well as identifying any gaps that you can discuss during a TA session. Take your time, but limit yourself to 2 one hour sessions for most problems.
